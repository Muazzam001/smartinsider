                            <span>The Conviction Rating is calculated for each transaction using an algorithm which combines, with equal weighting, the three factors described above at the time of Announcement. The result is an overall score of between 0 and 100. Where a director's holding is not available at the time of the announcement of the deal, the Conviction Rating is calculated using just the Transaction Type and Value scores. If a transaction cannot be scored it is assigned a zero Conviction Rating.</span>

                                <li><span><b>Transaction Type:</b> <br> A Buy will be considered more significant than a transaction which has some remunerative element such as an Award or Exercise of Options. Each Transaction type is weighted (scale 1-100) based on a rank order determined by Smart Insider analysis, according to how indicative it may be of the Directors perceived future share price performance.</span>

                                <li><span><b>Transaction Value:</b>  The historic distribution of deal values for each transaction type in the Smart Insider database (Buy, Sell etc.) is determined. A standard score based on the median and quartiles of the relevant transaction type's distribution is assigned to each deal. This score is rescaled to give a number between 0 and 100, with a cap at 100. This scores the transactions importance relative to the history of the values of that type of transaction across all directors for the years covered in the database.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li><span><b>Change in Holding:</b>  As directors have different means (ie Â£5,000 may be a lot of money to some directors, small change to others) the percentage change in holding caused by the transaction is also calculated as a score of the deal's significance to the director. Larger changes are considered to be more significant. Deals increasing a director's holding have their score capped at 100 for consistency with the maximum available to deals which reduce holdings.</span>

                            <span>As an index, Conviction Rating is a number between 1 and 100 which puts the most significant transactions at 100 and the least at 0.
